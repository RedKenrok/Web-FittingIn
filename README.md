# Fitting in

Fitting in is a two person co-operative game where one player takes control of the phone, the other stands in front of the back facing camera. The phone holder then has to tell -not show- the other how to has to pose themself based on the instruction on screen. The better you do the more points you will earn.

The game utilizes PoseNet a neural network model build for Tensorflow.js made by Google's Deepmind team. Thanks to Tensorflow.js' ability to run locally on the browser all calculations happen on the device itself to ensure your privacy.

## Requirements

To play the game grab a friend and open this webpage on a recent version of Chrome or FireFox using an Android device with a backwards facing camera. (Might work on other devices and browsers but has not been tested.)

## Development

This game has been made by [Ron Dekker](https://www.rondekker.nl) and [Jesse Deerenberg](https://linkedin.com/in/jesse-deerenberg-b324113b) during the Global Game Jam of 2019.
